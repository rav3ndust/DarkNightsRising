#  
A simple, text-based adventure game with TTS. Aims to be playable on any Linux distribution, with minimal dependencies.

The entire thing is written in shell script, and the game works together as a family of shell scripts. 
Variables that need to be called through different scripts are done through an automatically-generated "variables.txt" file. 

Dark Nights Rising is going to be about isolation and how the feeling of loneliness can pervade your mind. The player aims to escape this situation through a series of fantasy scenarios that are affected by choices the player makes as the game goes on. 

There is also some original soundtrack content and art that accompanies this game to add to the atmosphere and make it more interesting. 

Dark Nights Rising is free and open-source software licensed under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), and you can feel free to help make it better by contributing. 

I would eventually like to make this something fun to play on Linux desktops and Linux phones, regardless of which distro they are running on.

**I should note that I am also planning on working on a port of this game to Python to make it a little more portable to other systems, as well as to give it a bit of a nicer graphical user interface, for users who would prefer such.**

**I will be working on this over time.**

# dependencies

- dialog
- flite
- mpg123
- python3 & pip 

 These programs should be available in every major Linux distribution's repositories. 

> psst...there's a handy set of installer scripts in the **/installers** folder. Just make sure to select the correct installer for your distribution. They're labeled - **/debian-installer**, **/arch-installer**, etc.

# how to play

To launch the game, just run it as you would any other Bash script on your system. 

Make sure you type in your responses EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR in the prompts when playing the game. At the moment, player responses *are* case-sensitive. I hope to fix this as development on the game goes on. 

Remember, this game is still a WIP, and is a side project. It has no funding and is simply being done for fun. Therefore, you can expect to find new bits of the game added to this repo every now and then if you enjoy playing it. When it is finished, I will aim to have some kind of actual "release" for it - I was thinking a full release on [itch](https://itch.io) would eventually be cool. 

If you do enjoy the game and want to help make it better faster, then the next section is for you. 

# contributing and development

If you'd like to help me make it better, please fork it, add whatever you would like, and send in your changes! If they are awesome and make sense with the concept of the game, I will merge them in.
